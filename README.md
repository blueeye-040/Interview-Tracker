# LeetCode Problem Tracker

A structured JSON-based tracker to organize and monitor your LeetCode problem-solving journey, categorized by topic (Array & String, Dynamic Programming, Linked List, Binary Tree, Graph, Two Pointers, Stack).

## Features

- Problem details stored by category.
- Tracks:
  - Problem title and link.
  - Difficulty level.
  - Time and space complexity.
  - Tags/techniques used.
  - Attempts count (auto-resettable).
  - Last solved date (auto-resettable).
  - Notes (custom, optional, auto-clearable).
- JSON structured for easy updates and parsing.
- Goals section for daily, weekly, and target completion tracking.

## File Structure

- **problems.json** â€“ Contains all LeetCode problems structured by category.
- Each problem includes:
  - `title`: Name of the problem.
  - `link`: Direct link to the LeetCode problem.
  - `difficulty`: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
  - `solution`: (Can be filled manually or kept empty as per progress.)
  - `timeComplexity` & `spaceComplexity`: For performance reference.
  - `tags`: Related techniques/topics.
  - `attempts`: Number of attempts (reset to 0 after clearing).
  - `lastSolved`: Date last solved (reset to empty after clearing).
  - `notes`: Additional notes (reset to empty after clearing).
  - `dateAdded`: When the problem was added to your tracker.

## How to Use

1. **Update the JSON manually** as you solve problems.
2. Use `attempts`, `lastSolved`, and `notes` to track your personal progress.
3. Solutions can be filled in directly or linked externally.
4. Reset values periodically for fresh practice sessions.
